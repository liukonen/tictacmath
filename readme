Tic Tac Math is a math game I created for my sister back in around 2003-2004. At the time it was writen in VB6 and used Microsoft Agents
(think Clippy, but a magician called Merlin) who would fly around the screen and play tic tac toe, using simple math equations.
I found the code, and re wrote it in .net. Also, MS agents died off so I am stuck with using only the MS Text to speach engine to talk to
you while playing the game. I had 4 different verisons, and since they were all based on the same source, consolidate the logic to one 
program, with options to switch math types (divide, multiply, add, and subtract)
