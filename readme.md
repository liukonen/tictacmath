# Tic Tac Math

Tic Tac Math is a math game that was initially created in 2003-2004 using Visual Basic 6 and Microsoft Agents. It involved a magician character named Merlin who would fly around the screen and play Tic Tac Toe using simple math equations. However, due to the discontinuation of Microsoft Agents, the game has undergone revisions and is now available as a web application.

## Web Application

The web version of Tic Tac Math was rewritten entirely in JavaScript, making it accessible and playable directly in a web browser. You can access the game at [https://liukonen.github.io/tictacmath/](https://liukonen.github.io/tictacmath/).

## Features and Revisions

- The original game was built using Visual Basic 6 and Microsoft Agents. However, due to the discontinuation of Microsoft Agents and changes in technology, the game has evolved.
- In 2020, the game was rewritten in JavaScript to create a web application version.
- The new version utilizes the MS Text-to-Speech engine to provide audio feedback during gameplay.
- The game now offers options to switch between different math types, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- The logic from the original multiple versions of the game has been consolidated into a single program, improving maintainability and usability.

## Technologies and Learnings

- The original version of Tic Tac Math was developed using Visual Basic 6 and Microsoft Agents.
- The revised web application version is built with JavaScript and utilizes the MS Text-to-Speech engine for audio feedback.
- The developer has gained experience in Visual Basic .NET, installers (such as Nullsoft and Microsoft One-Click Installer), and working with different technologies over the years.

Please note that there are no plans to port the game to another language or platform at this time.
