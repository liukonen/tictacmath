#About
Tic Tac Math is a math game I created for my sister back in around 2003-2004.

#revisions

In 2003/4 I wrote this in Visual basic 6 and used Microsoft Agents as driving forces for Input and output. 
(think Clippy, but a magician called Merlin) who would fly around the screen and play tic tac toe, using simple math equations.
I found the original source code, and re wrote it in .net. Also, sometime around Windows Vista MS agents died off so I am stuck with using 
only the MS Text to speach engine to talk to you while playing the game. I had 4 different verisons, and since they were all based on the same source, consolidate the logic to one 
program, with options to switch math types (divide, multiply, add, and subtract) Since the original version was written in VB 6, I have no plans on
porting this over to c# or another laungage (yet)
